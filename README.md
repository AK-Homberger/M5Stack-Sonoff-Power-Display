To use the program on the M5Stack you have to install a Sonoff POW R2 device on the boat external power connection.

The Tasmota firmware have to be flashed on the device (I'm using version 7.2). The flashing procedure is detailled here: https://www.tasmota.info/sonoff-pow-r2-flash/ and here: https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/wiki/sonoff-pow-r2
